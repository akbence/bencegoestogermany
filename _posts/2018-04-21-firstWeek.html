<p>My first week was a really long one. It was full of events, new people, new places, new things. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Wednesday</h2>

<p>Everything started with an Orientation course. We headed north with Peter to reach the campus where the course was hold. As we entered the university some guys gave us some 
    leaflet... about the next PARTY. Wow I was impressed. First and most important thing the actual dates of the upcoming parties. After that came some boring time. The local guide
    of the exchange students held an "interesting" lecture about some how-to, where-to, when-to, what-never-to-do etc. information... with special regard to the second WW stereotypes. 
    We were introduced to the everyday routine of the German people, how "punctual" are they (ofc, bus and S-bahn never comes as scheduled), how to organize and collect in separate
    boxes the trash and I can continue this list for an eternity. After that we were invited to the university's canteen. The food was really good and finally we could discuss with
    fellow exchange students. At this time an Italien guy created a Whatsup group to make communication more easier. It was really interesting for me that many people even from America
    came with proper German language skills. Fortunately we choose English as our official language because 40% of the group had no German language skills at all. After the lunch, with Peter we
    decided to visit some of the local supermarkets. There are several of them here in Erlangen but our favorites are the Lidl and Netto. The prices are surprisingly good (except
    for the meats) and they provide a wide variety of offers.

<h2 class="section-heading">Thursday</h2>

<p>This day was mainly about getting all the papers get all the necessary stuff. That day I opened a German bank account, went to the city hall to register myself as a citizen
    in Erlangen for this short period. After all these things I met with some fellow student to eat out somewhere. We tried out the plaza of the city it is called "Arcadien" which
    provided many restaurants for us. The kebab which I took was about 4 Euros. I really liked it because the pitta was more crunchy than other ones back in Hungary. As we ate,
    fortunately we discussed the papers what we needed for the registration at friday. The Italian guy mentioned, that dealing with a health insurances was a bit annoying because
    the lady offered her many plus options, for bigger payment of course. In that moment I realized that I forgot to deal with that health insurance, because it is not enough to
    have a blue EU card about that.... So after that I went to deal with that thing as well. At the end of the day, I looked at my watch which was showing more than 22000 steps.
    Nice amount for a day of walking, so Erlangen is not small as a I thought it before. I will definitely need a bike ASAP!!!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Friday</h2>

<p>In the morning we headed back to the university where the registration held. They just collected the papers from us and promised a sightseeing tour around the city from noon.
    So we waited for it to begin. We were split into 2 groups depended on the language of the tour. Of course I chose the English. We went up to the oldest calvinistic church's 
    bell tower where the old lady told us many thing about the history of the town. It was really, really exicting.... for the first 5 minutes. But guys don't worry I avoid the 
    boring stuff right now just a note in a nutshell: the city had some ups and downs but nowadays its prospering.

<p>Another fun fact was that the entire population of Erlangen
    changes every 10 year so its really just a city for short time businesses in people's life... except the Siemens. After the bell tower the group went down and visited 2 more places.
    The first one was an old traditional German house with a cute inner yard. Our next station was the beautiful Orangerie. When we reach that place our old lady guide was quite excited.
    She said that with every group she makes a group picture. Only thing that I missed was the water from the fountain :D Another fun fact: an Italian guy said that I almost look like
    as Mr. Matt Damon. Since that point some people just call me Mr. Damon. :D (It costs me my incognito but anyway... worth it)

<h2 class="section-heading">Weekend</h2>

<p> Erlangen doesn't have an official ESN community. It gave me a reason to be afraid of any events which was organized to exchange students. Luckily they organized a pretty good pub
    crawl there. Unfortunately with Peter we joined only in the middle of the event but despite from that it was fantastic. The beers of Bavaria... tastes like heaven. As it was an 
    official event for us exchange students they also provided some discount from the beverages at each place. To be honest sometimes the prices with that advantage are still high a bit.
    After the pub crawl we decided to visit a local discotheque. It was a free party but some guys in the group was too drunk to enter so the security guys didn't allow them to pass.
    So... after losing the half of the group :'( we entered the place. Well... I used to listen to good music so I didn't enjoy this party so much. Only 3 or 4 tracks was good all the others
    were sooo bad. Anyway first party in Erlangen, somewhere I need to start.
</p>

<p> The next day I visited a flea market with Peter. We hoped we could buy a bike which didn't happen. But Peter bought himself a plate because he didn't bring any. He also made a
    bargain with the seller to buy the plate cheaper. She aggreed this counteroffer surprisingly fast so the deal was made. At the time we were really hungry therefore we bought a "german hot-dog".
    Bratwurst exactly. It was delicious, in the future I will definitely want to buy more.

    Soon I post the second week's events if I had time to write all the things down. I need to start the university which will be interesting because I don't even received my account
    for the course registration. But that is a story.. for another time :). Bye for now.
