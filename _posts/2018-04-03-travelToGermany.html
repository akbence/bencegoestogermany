<p>It begins... with a really early wake up. My parents helped me to travel to Erlangen, actually the plan was to travel by car. 
    So everybody woke up at 4 a.m. and started to prepare for the journey. Yesterday we already packed the our little Suzuki with all the stuff, to
    make it easier to start off from home. According to Google Maps the distance around 800 km. Well... without problems, which we of course encountered a lot.

<h2 class="section-heading">Leaving Hungary</h2>

<p>Leaving the home country wasn't easy at all. When we started off we got some reports about an accident on the motorway. Unfortunately it delayed us for more than 2 hours
    We need to even modify a bit our route and still we were in 2 hours late. We stopped to eat near Győr, when I took the wheel from my father. At first i thought that we will switch back soon
    but I really enjoyed driving abroad so I decided we only change back, when we arrive at Erlangen. Later in Austria I made a mistake and instead of driving on the outer ring road
    so we entered into Wien. It incrased our travelling time so I decided to e-mail to my accomodation to inform them about my delay. Which I couldn't do, because our phones blocked in Austria.
    So I hoped, that it won't be a problem that we arrive late... Well, I was a bit naive.

<h2 class="section-heading">Herzlich Willkommen</h2>

<p>Finally around 4 p.m. we arrived and entered into the dorm. The landlady was very kind at first, she gave me some papers to read it through. Another guy was late too and he was sitting
    at a table, so I joined to him. A few minutes later the landlady invited us to her office room where her first sentence was: "To be punctual, arrive at time is a really important thing in Germany".
    Not the best start... Anyway I just took the keys and later on entered my room. Not big, not the best, but its mine for this semester. After I unpacked everything I said goodbye to my parents, and realized
    that it began. An entire semester abroad.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Alone, but not at all</h2>

<p>I forgot to mention I didn't came to here alone. A year ago I decided with my fellow roommate back in Hungary to have an Erasmus semester. He is called Péter Therefore, when my parents left we went to have
    a dinner at the neariest Burger King and visited a liquor store to buy some Bavarian beers. After we opened the beers and tasted it Péter just realised that we had no clue about the rules related to drinking
    in public places / streets. So that was the first day and I believe it will be an unforgettable experience.

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
