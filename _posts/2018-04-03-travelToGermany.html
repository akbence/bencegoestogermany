<p>It begins... with a really early wake up. My parents helped me to travel to Erlangen, actually the plan was to travel by car. 
    So everybody woke up at 4 a.m. and started to prepare for the journey. Yesterday we already packed the our little Suzuki with all the stuff, to
    make it easier to start off from home. According to Google Maps the distance around 800 km. Well... without problems, which we of course encountered a lot.

<h2 class="section-heading">Leaving Hungary</h2>

<p>Leaving the home country wasn't easy at all. When we started off, we got some reports about an accident on the motorway. Unfortunately it delayed us for more than 2 hours
    We need to even modify a bit our route and still we were in 2 hours late. We stopped to eat near Győr, when I took the wheel from my father. At first i thought that we will switch soon
    but i just really enjoyed driving abroad so I decided we only change back when we arrive at Erlangen. Unfortunately I made a mistake and instead of driving on the outer ring road
    so we entered into Wien. It incrased our travelling time so I decided to e-mail to my accomodation to inform them about my delay. Which I couldn't do, because our phones blocked in Austria.
    So i hoped, that it won't be a problem that we arrive late.

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
